# FIFA-Player-Analysis-with-Tableau

Welcome to my FIFA 19 Player Data Analysis project! This repository showcases my exploration of the FIFA 19 dataset, which contains detailed information about over 18,000 football players worldwide. Using Tableau, I created interactive dashboards to analyze player performance, market value, and growth potential.

## About the Project  

This project is based on EA Sports' FIFA 19 video game simulation. The dataset includes detailed player attributes such as performance ratings, financial data, and specific skill metrics.  

The primary objectives of this project were:  
- To analyze the key attributes of football players and clubs.  
- To create visually appealing dashboards for insights into player performance and market trends.  
- To identify players with high growth potential and analyze goalkeeping skills.

- **Financial Data**: Market value, wage.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Overall rating, potential rating, and growth potential.  
- **Skill Ratings**: Attributes like passing, dribbling, and goalkeeping.  

## Dashboards  

I created five key dashboards to analyze the data:  

### 1. **Top 10 Clubs by Player Value**  
A bar chart ranking clubs based on the total market value of their players.  
- **Insight**: Clubs like Real Madrid and FC Barcelona dominate the rankings.  

### 2. **Top 10 Players by Market Value**  
A visualization of individual players with the highest market value.  
- **Insight**: Lionel Messi lead the list due to his exceptional skills and popularity.  

### 3. **Top 10 Players by Growth Potential**  
A chart showcasing players with the highest potential to improve their performance.

- Used **parameters** for interactivity (e.g., selecting player positions).  
- Created **calculated fields** to filter data dynamically.  

### **Step 3: Insights Generation**  
- Explored player and club trends through dashboards.  
- Focused on unique metrics like growth potential and goalkeeping skills.

## Conclusion
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling, all while deepening my understanding of football analytics.
